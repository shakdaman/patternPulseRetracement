# Pattern Pulse Radar - Usage Guide

## Overview

The Pattern Pulse Radar is a comprehensive multi-ticker, multi-timeframe scanner designed to detect **3-2 Strat patterns** and **Inside Bar patterns** across multiple markets. The radar is optimized to catch early signals, giving you the earliest possible entry points for Strat trading strategies.

## Key Features

### Early Pattern Detection
- **3-2 Bull**: Outside Bar → 2-Up (immediate signal)
- **3-2 Bear**: Outside Bar → 2-Down (immediate signal)
- **3-2 Rev Bull**: Outside Bar → 2-Down → 2-Up (reversal signal)
- **3-2 Rev Bear**: Outside Bar → 2-Up → 2-Down (reversal signal)
- **Inside Bar**: Consolidation pattern indicating potential breakout

### Consistent Pattern Detection
- **Timeframe Independence**: Patterns detected using actual HTF data, not current chart timeframe
- **Reliable Signals**: If a monthly bar is an inside bar, it will always show as an inside bar
- **Chart Flexibility**: Switch between 1H, 4H, D, W, M charts without losing pattern accuracy

### Multi-Timeframe Scanning
- **4H**: 4-hour charts for intraday patterns
- **D**: Daily charts for swing patterns
- **W**: Weekly charts for position patterns
- **M**: Monthly charts for trend patterns

### Intelligent Batching
- 8 predefined ticker batches (8 tickers each)
- 32 requests per batch (8 tickers × 4 timeframes)
- Stays within Pine Script V6 40-request limit
- Easy batch rotation for comprehensive market coverage

## Getting Started

### 1. Basic Setup
1. Add the Pattern Pulse Radar to your TradingView chart
2. Select your desired batch (1-8) from the settings
3. Choose your timeframes to scan and display
4. Adjust pattern sensitivity if needed

### 2. Understanding the Display

- **Red**: Bearish patterns (3-2 Bear, 3-2 Rev Bear)
- **Orange**: Inside Bar patterns
- **Gray**: No patterns detected
- **Yellow Dots (●)**: Pattern count indicators (max 4 dots)

### 3. Batch Selection

#### Available Batches
1. **Major Indices & ETFs**: SPY, QQQ, IWM, DIA, GLD, SLV, TLT, HYG

## Pattern Detection Logic

### 3-2 Strat Patterns

#### Primary 3-2 Patterns (Early Signals)
- **3-2 Bull**: Outside Bar followed immediately by 2-Up bar
- **3-2 Bear**: Outside Bar followed immediately by 2-Down bar
- **Purpose**: Catch the earliest possible entry signals

#### Alternative 3-2 Patterns (Reversal Signals)
- **3-2 Rev Bull**: Outside Bar → 2-Down → 2-Up (reversal after first directional move)
- **3-2 Rev Bear**: Outside Bar → 2-Up → 2-Down (reversal after first directional move)
- **Purpose**: Catch reversal signals after the first directional move

### Inside Bar Patterns
- **Definition**: High < High[1] AND Low > Low[1]
- **Purpose**: Identify consolidation periods that may precede breakouts

### Consistency Across Timeframes
The radar ensures that pattern detection is consistent regardless of which timeframe you're viewing:

- **Monthly Inside Bar**: If a monthly bar is an inside bar, it will show as an inside bar whether you're viewing 1H, 4H, D, or W charts
- **Weekly 3-2 Pattern**: A weekly 3-2 pattern will be detected consistently across all chart timeframes
- **Data Source**: Uses actual HTF (Higher Timeframe) data for pattern detection, not the current chart's timeframe
- **Reliability**: This ensures you get the same pattern signals regardless of which chart timeframe you're using

## Alert System

### Alert Types
1. **Inside Bar Detected**: Consolidation pattern found
2. **3-2 Bullish Early**: Outside Bar → 2-Up pattern detected
3. **3-2 Bearish Early**: Outside Bar → 2-Down pattern detected
4. **3-2 Bullish Reversal**: Outside Bar → 2-Down → 2-Up pattern detected
5. **3-2 Bearish Reversal**: Outside Bar → 2-Up → 2-Down pattern detected

### Setting Up Alerts
1. Right-click on the chart
2. Select "Add Alert"
3. Choose the Pattern Pulse Radar
4. Select your desired alert conditions
5. Configure notification settings

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Batch View
- Enable "Show Multiple Batches" to see pattern summaries from other batches
- Shows compact summary tables for up to 4 batches simultaneously
- Each summary shows 3 sample tickers with pattern dot indicators
- Useful for getting overview of pattern activity across sectors

### Debug Mode
- Enable "Show Debug Info" for additional information
- Shows current batch, ticker count, and timeframe information
- Helpful for troubleshooting and optimization

### Pattern Sensitivity
- **Volume Spike Factor**: Adjust volume confirmation requirements
- **Require Confirmation**: Wait for next candle to confirm patterns
- **Require Volume Confirmation**: Require above-average volume for pattern validity

## Trading Strategy Integration

### Early Entry Strategy
1. **Watch for 3-2 patterns**: These give you the earliest possible entry signals
2. **Position for second "2"**: The 3-2 pattern often leads to a complete 3-2-2 formation
3. **Use multiple timeframes**: Confirm patterns across different timeframes for higher probability
4. **Monitor Inside Bars**: These often precede significant moves

### Risk Management
1. **Set stop losses**: Use the Outside Bar's high/low as reference points
2. **Position sizing**: Adjust based on timeframe and pattern strength
3. **Confirmation**: Wait for volume confirmation if enabled
4. **Multiple timeframes**: Look for confluence across timeframes

## Performance Optimization

### Request Management
- The radar uses exactly 32 requests per batch (8 tickers × 4 timeframes)
- This leaves 8 requests available for additional functionality
- Batch rotation ensures comprehensive market coverage

### Memory Management
- Visual objects are cleaned up regularly
- Efficient data structures minimize memory usage
- Performance monitoring helps maintain smooth operation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **No patterns detected**: Check if tickers are valid and have sufficient data
2. **Slow performance**: Reduce number of timeframes or enable debug mode
3. **Missing alerts**: Verify alert conditions are properly configured
4. **Pattern accuracy**: Adjust sensitivity parameters as needed

### Best Practices
1. **Start with one batch**: Test with a single batch before using multiple batches
2. **Monitor performance**: Watch for any slowdowns or errors
3. **Regular updates**: Keep the script updated for best performance
4. **Backup settings**: Save your preferred configuration
